    Welcome to the first Snapshot version of Fera Fortunius! You can move with *Z-Q-S-D*, run with *shift* and attack with *X*. If you prefer the mouse, *left click* is attacking and *right click* is moving. Go for a walk on this map, with the little Languide that you control. You can also pick up objects when you get closer to them. Press *E* to let the text continue.
